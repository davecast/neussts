            <p class="text--small mb--x1">
              The variable-speed drive (VSD) is a highly sophisticated
              switchboard-motor controller. A VSD performs three distinct
              functions. It varies the capacity of the ESP by varying the motor
              speed, protects downhole components from power transients, and
              provides “soft-start” capability. A VSD changes the capacity of
              the ESP by varying the motor speed. By changing the voltage
              frequency supplied to the motor and thus motor rpm, the capacity
              of the pump is also changed in a linear relationship. This applies
              to both long-range reservoir changes and short-term transients
              such as those associated with high-GOR wells. This may eliminate
              the need to change the capacity of a pump to match changing well
              conditions, or it may mean longer run life by preventing cycling
              problems. This capability is also useful in determining the
              productivity of new wells by documenting pressure and production
              values over a range of drawdown rates. The change in voltage
              frequency can be made manually or automatically. The VSD can
              operate automatically in a “closed loop” mode with a programmable
              controller and pressure-sensing instrument.
            </p>
            <p class="text--small mb--x1">
              The VSD also protects the downhole motor from poor-quality
              electricity power.
            </p>
            <p class="text--small">
              The soft-start capability of a VSD provides two major benefits.
              First, it reduces the startup drain on the power system. Second,
              the strain on the pump shaft (and its associated components) is
              significantly reduced when compared with that of a standard start.
              This capability is valuable in gassy or sandy wells. In some
              cases, slowly ramping a pump up to operating speed may avoid pump
              damage.

              The casing head ,a component connecting the casing to the wellhead
              assembly of various types and sizes ,is used to support the both
              the intermediate (protective) string and the production string
              ,and to seal up the annular space between the casings, thus
              providing a crossover connection for the installation of the bop
              ,the tubing head, the Christmas tree and other top wellhead
              components. It is also used to inject additional cement slurry or
              balance fluid, monitor the well sink, and execute other operations
              through both of the two bypass holes in the casing head body.
